## Task-24 [Section 7 - Final Exam]: Good Luck :D

* First we will try to find hidden directories using gobuster. This can be done using command (*gobuster dir -u http://ip -w medium.txt -t 100*). We found a directory called 'secret'. Open in browser and we see that it is a blank page. Maybe it contains some more hidden files. So we will search for hidden files, in this case, a text file. Type (*gobuster dir -u http://ip/secret -w medium.txt -t 100 -x txt*). We found a secret file 'secret.txt' which contains 'nyan:hash_of_password'. We have username and just need password for ssh login. This is 'sha1' and can be cracked using hashcat using command (*hashcat -m 100 hash_to_crack rockyou.txt*). We found the password as 'nyan'. Now we can login to ssh using command (*ssh nyan@ip*) and type password obtained above. Now we have gain access to 'nyan' and have a shell. Type 'ls' to list files. We find a 'user.txt' which is the answer to our first question. Now try to locate 'root.txt' using command (*locate root.txt*). But we don't have permission for it as we are not root, So to become root type (*sudo su*). Now we are in the root shell and type 'ls'. We have 'root.txt' file which is our answer to last question
 
1. What is the user.txt<br>
Answer : superno******

2. What is the root.txt<br>
Answer : congrat************
